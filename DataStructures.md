# Data Structures

## ARRAY

- indexed order
- contiguous
- insertion & deletion can be expensive
- quick access via index

## HASH TABLE

- unordered
- constant time look up O(1)

## LINKED LIST

- allows us to traverse the list backwards (double)
- donâ€™t have indexes
- connection w/ node via pointers
- random access NOT allowed

### Single LL

- not always constant removal

### DoubleLL

- constant removal
- For searching check the length and either start at end or beginning depending on which index is passed in. DIVIDE AND CONQUER. BETTER FOR FINDING THINGS BUT TAKES UP MORE MEMORY DUE TO EXTRA POINTER

## Stack

- LIFO -> only touch item on top (peek)
- fast operations
- fast peek O(1)
- ordered
- slow lookup - O(n)

## Queue

- FIFO -> only touch item on bottom
- fast operations
- fast peek
- ordered
- slow lookup
